# Medix

**Visit the site: https://charugoyal3.github.io/Medix/**

This project is initiated in a hackathon:

1. To bridge the gap between the people who have EXCESS MEDICINES with them and the people who NEED MEDICINES and don't have enough money to buy it.

2. To educate people about the medicines they have in their home and their usages.


**Problem Statement we picked**

Many people, including us, have stocks of medicines with us which we don't know what they are for OR are useless to us.
